# Download-IOCBucket
Formerly an iMacros macro to download IOC bucket IOC and YARA files

Now a Python 2.7 script to download all IOCs and avoid unnecessary requests to IOCBucket.com

There is currently no "download all" so this will download all [IOC](http://openioc.org/) and [YARA](http://plusvic.github.io/yara/) files on [IOCBucket.com](https://www.iocbucket.com/).
